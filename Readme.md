## Features

- **Modular Architecture:**  
  Effortlessly add, remove, or modify commands and features; plugin-friendly structure.

- **Shipping System:**  
  Fun shipping commands with persistent stats, including `/ship`, `/last`, `/mystats`, and `/top` for user pairings and leaderboards.

- **TypeScript First:**  
  Full type safety and modern development experience.

- **Discord.js v14:**  
  Built on top of the latest Discord.js library for robust Discord API support.

- **Environment Configuration:**  
  Secure, environment-based configuration management via `.env` and [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

- **Developer Experience:**  
  Clear structure, helpful error handling, and easy command creation.

- **Economy System:**  
  Earn, spend, and play with fops ðŸ¦Š (the in-bot currency) through commands like `/balance`, `/pay`, `/daily`, and `/playgame`.

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js v18.0.0 or newer** (LTS recommended)
- **Discord Bot Token** ([Get one here](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- **(Optional) Git** for easy cloning and updates

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/KibaOfficial/kio-tsbot.git
   cd kio-tsbot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your credentials:
     - `BOT_ID` - Your bot's client (application) ID
     - `BOT_TOKEN` - Your bot's secret token
     - `GUILD_ID` - *(Development only)* Your test server's Guild ID
     - `NODE_ENV` - `development` for local testing, `production` for deployment

4. **(Optional) Discord Intents:**
   - Some features require privileged intents (e.g. `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT`).  
     Enable these in your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) under your bot's settings.

---

## Usage

### Development

Run the bot in development mode (TypeScript, with hot-reloading):
```sh
npm run dev
```

### Production

Build and start the bot:
```sh
npm run build
npm start
```

---

## Adding Commands

- Place new command files in `src/commands/` or subfolders (e.g. `src/commands/yourCommandCategory/`).
- Each command should export a `Command` object with a `data` property (built using `SlashCommandBuilder`) and an async `execute` function.

#### Example Command

```typescript
import { SlashCommandBuilder } from 'discord.js';
import { Command } from '../types';

export const example: Command = {
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
    .setName('example')
    .setDescription('An example command'),
  async execute(interaction) {
    await interaction.reply('This is an example command!');
  },
};
```

---

## Hosting & Deployment

- Kio-TsBot can run on any Node.js-compatible environment:
  - **Railway**, **Heroku**, **Render**, **Glitch**, **Repl.it**, **VPS**, or **Docker**.
- For Docker, you can use the included `Dockerfile` or create your own.
- Make sure to keep your `.env` file secret and never commit your bot token to public repos!
