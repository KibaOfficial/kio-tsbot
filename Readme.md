## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/KibaOfficial/kio-tsbot.git
   cd kio-tsbot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your credentials:
     - `BOT_ID` - Your bot's client (application) ID
     - `BOT_TOKEN` - Your bot's secret token
     - `GUILD_ID` - *(Development only)* Your test server's Guild ID
     - `NODE_ENV` - `development` for local testing, `production` for deployment

---

## Usage

### Development

Run the bot in development mode (TypeScript, with hot-reloading):
```sh
npm run dev
```

### Production

Build and start the bot:
```sh
npm run build
npm start
```

---

## Adding Commands

- Place new command files in `src/commands/` following the examples (`ping.ts`, `invite.ts`).
- Each command should export a `Command` object with a `data` property (built using `SlashCommandBuilder`) and an async `execute` function.

#### Example Command

```typescript
import { SlashCommandBuilder } from 'discord.js';
import { Command } from '../types';

export const example: Command = {
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
    .setName('example')
    .setDescription('An example command'),
  async execute(interaction) {
    await interaction.reply('This is an example command!');
  },
};
```
