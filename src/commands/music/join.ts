 * Join command for Discord bot.
 * This command allows the bot to join the user's voice channel.
 * It checks if the user is in a voice channel and if the bot is already connected to a voice channel.
 * If the bot is not connected, it creates a new queue and connects to the user's voice channel.
 * @type {Command}
 * @property {SlashCommandBuilder} data - The command data for the join command.
 * @property {function} execute - The function that executes the command when invoked.
 * @returns {Promise<void>} - A promise that resolves when the command execution is complete.
