# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: May 27, 2025_

This privacy policy applies to the Discord bot **Kio-TsBot** (including "Kio-TsBot(Dev)"), operated by **KibaOfficial**.

## What Data Is Collected?

- **Discord User IDs**  
  User IDs are stored for features such as the economy system and the shipping service.  
  Example data:
  ```json
  {
    "123456789012345678": {
      "balance": 1000,
      "inventory": ["nickname_change"],
      "lastDaily": "2025-05-26T22:00:00Z"
    }
  }

  ```
- **No Other Personal Data**  
  No personal information (such as names, email addresses, or messages) is collected or stored.

## How Is Your Data Used?

- Your Discord user ID and related economy data are used only to provide bot features such as balances, inventories, and daily rewards.
- For the "shipping" feature, the bot randomly pairs user IDs for entertainment purposes.

## Where Is Your Data Stored?

- All data is stored on a private server located in Germany, within the European Union, inside local JSON files.
- The bot runs in a Docker container; no data is transmitted outside the operator's private infrastructure.

## Third Parties

- **No Data Sharing:**  
  No user data is shared with any third parties, partners, or analytics services.

## Data Security

- All reasonable measures are taken to keep your data safe on the server.
- However, as this is a private hobby project, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

## Data Removal

- To request data removal, contact the operator via email or Discord with your user ID. Your data will be deleted within a reasonable timeframe.

## Contact

- Email: [kiba@kibaofficial.net](mailto:kiba@kibaofficial.net)

This privacy policy may be updated in the future. Please check back for updates.
